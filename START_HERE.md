# START HERE - Read This First

**For all AI agents working on this project:**

Before responding to any request, you MUST read these files:

1. **[PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md](./PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md)** - Original project requirements and architecture
2. **[.agent/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md](./.agent/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md)** - Development process and standards

These files define:
- Your role as senior TypeScript/React architect
- The project's purpose and technical requirements
- Expected working style (plan first, ask before big changes)
- Database, testing, and deployment standards

**Do not proceed without reading these files first.**
